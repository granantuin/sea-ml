# Sea-ML

This repository offers machine learning models and tools designed to predict meteorological variables from coastal stations provided by MeteoGalicia, the regional meteorological service. It includes machine learning algorithms, primarily from the scikit-learn library, deployed through operational.py. The models are specifically trained on meteorological data collected from each station, with the directories named according to the respective station they represent.

## Directory Structure
Each directory corresponds to a coastal meteorological station from the MeteoGalicia service. These directories contain datasets, scripts, and machine learning models tailored for specific stations.

## Usage

### Input Files

- **station_name.csv**: A CSV file containing observed meteorological variables for a given station. This file is generated as an output from the [MeteoGalicia](https://www.meteogalicia.gal/observacion/estacions/estacions.action?request_locale=gl) data portal.

- **get_wrf_(a)k.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook designed to retrieve historical meteorological data from WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) models provided by MeteoGalicia, where `(a)` indicates the spatial resolution in kilometers (e.g., 4 km or 1 km). This notebook fetches data that is used for model training and analysis.

- **distan_lat(a)_lon(b)_p(c)_R(d)Km.csv**: A CSV file that lists the coordinates of the `c` nearest WRF model grid points to a specific station, identified by its latitude `(a)` and longitude `(b)`. The file also includes the distance `(d)` in kilometers between each model grid point and the station. This file is generated by the `get_wrf_4k.ipynb` notebook.

- **lat(a)_lon(b)_p(c)_R(d)Km.kml**: A KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file containing the geospatial data from the corresponding CSV file. It visualizes the WRF model grid points around the station, making it easy to view in GIS tools such as Google Earth. This file is an output from the `get_wrf_(a)k.ipynb` notebook.

- **lat(a)_lon(b)_p(c)_R(d)Km_D(e)_Y(f).csv**: A CSV file containing forecasted meteorological variables from the WRF model, with a forecast range of `Day (e)` for the year `Y(f)`. The variables are organized based on proximity to the station: variables with the subindex `0` correspond to the nearest grid point to the station’s coordinates `(a, b)`, and subsequent subindices represent increasingly distant grid points. The distance between forecasted points is denoted by `(d)`. This file is produced by the `get_wrf_(a)k.ipynb` notebook.
